# ttydump

Display bytes read from a specified serial port in various output formats.
Kind of like `hexdump`, but for your serial port.

## Usage

Argument | Option | Comment
--- | --- | ---
`-p` | Device path | **Required**, example: `/dev/cu.usbserial-DEADA55`
`-b <baud>` | Baud rate | *Optional*, default: `115200`
`-o <filename>` | Output filename | *Optional*, binary output file path, example: `~/path/to/file.out`
`-w <columns>` | Column width | *Optional*, `1-128`, default: `8 bytes`
`-s` | Single line output | *Optional*, default: `off`
`-c` | Color output | *Optional*, default: `on`
`-d` | Decimal output | *Optional*, default: `off`
`-z` | Zero prefix output | *Optional*, default: `off`
`-a` | ASCII output format | Output ASCII printable characters + `\x00` style escaped bytes for non-printables
`-m` | MIDI output format | Interpret and display received bytes as MIDI packets
`-h` | Show command help | Show this list without opening a connection

## Prerequisites

* Serial port or usb-serial adapter
* Unix/Linux-based operating system with `/dev/cu.*` or `/dev/tty.*`
* `gcc`, `libc`, and a C compiler
* Optional: Color-enabled terminal emulator

## Compiling

The program is entirely contained within a single source (`src/ttydump.c`), so compile it as you please:
```
$ gcc ./src/ttydump.c -o ./bin/ttydump
```

## Installing

Copy the executable to a location in your `$PATH`, for example:

```
$ cp ./bin/ttydump /usr/local/bin/
```

## Examples

Default output format (hexadecimal, 8-byte column width, 115200 baud)
Only the device path argument `-p` is required:
```
$ ttydump -p /dev/ttyUSB0
```

Decimal, zero-prefixed, 16 columns, 9600 baud:
```
$ ttydump -p /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 9600 -w 16 -z
```

MIDI, default baud rate (115200), color-coded status bytes, decimal:
```
$ ttydump -p /dev/cu.usbmodem001 -mcd
```

Hexadecimal, 4 columns, default baud rate (115200), additionally write raw binary data to output file:
```
$ ttydump -p /dev/cu.usbserial-DEADA55 -o ~/test/file.out
```

## Notes

* I have not tested extensively on any platforms other than macOS 10.12, macOS 10.14, and Ubuntu 18.04. Nonetheless, no special or OS-specific functionality is used (other than the required platform-specific baud rate defines), and there are no dependencies outside of the standard C library, so it should hopefully compile and run.

* If you find a problem on *one of the above platforms*, please report it. If you find a problem on *another platform*, please fix it yourself. Do not bother reporting a problem on an unsupported platform without also submitting a fix. This is just a small utility I use daily when developing at home, and I am not interested in convoluting it to make it run on your microwave, or preventing Elliot Alderson from hacking into my FTDI cable. If this is your thing, by all means, clone it, rename it, and do as you please, or better yet, write your own.

* The program uses an advisory lock mechanism, `flock()`, on the opened serial device, but unless this is also implemented in other utilities you are using (for example, `screen`), multiple processes may be able to open the device simultaneously, which can cause strange behavior. This is not unique to this utility.

* On Linux (and possibly others), make sure your user is a member of the group that owns the serial tty device (this is the `dialout` group by default on Ubuntu). You can add yourself to it with the following command: `sudo gpasswd --add ${USER} dialout`
